            <h3>Tutorial</h3>
            Welcome to EasyML! In this tutorial we will be creating and testing a machine learning model on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set">Iris flower data set</a>
            with the goal of correctly classifying species of Iris flowers based on some basic features of the flower.<br><br>
            Get started by uploading the data you'd like to train your model with by navigating to the <strong>Upload Data</strong> tab to the left.
            <br>
            <br>
            <img class="tut-img" src="/static/img/tutorial/data_upload_1.png">
            <br>
            <br>
            After your data is uploaded, navigate to the <strong>Manage Data</strong> page using the sidebar in order to see your data. Here,
            two other files are uploaded in addition to <i>iris_train</i>: <i>iris_test</i> and <i>iris_test_unlabeled</i>. <i>iris_test</i> is the "answer key"
            to the model that will be used to check our answers later, and <i>iris_test_unlabeled</i> will be used to generate predictions made using a model trained on the data in <i>iris_train</i>.
            <br>
            <br>
            <img class="tut-img" src="/static/img/tutorial/manage_data_1.png">
            <br>
            <br>
            After verifying that all necessary data has been uploaded properly, it is time to train the model! Navigate to the <strong>Train Model</strong>
            tab and select the file you'd like to train your model with.
            <br>
            <br>
            <img class="tut-img" src="/static/img/tutorial/train_model_1.png">
            <br>
            <br>
            When the training data has been selected, you will be redirected to a page with options about how to generate your model.
            The table at the top of the page contains your data column headers as well as an option for how you would like to handle each one.
            By default, all data is treated as input to the model. Before moving forward, select the <strong>target</strong> option for the column that you would
            like to use your model to predict and select the <strong>input</strong> and <strong>ignore</strong> options for columns you'd like to use to make your predictions and
            ignore entirely, respectively.<br><br>
            When this step is completed, select your desired algorithm and tune the settings if you'd like. The default settings will produce strong models
            for general cases, but you may need to change these for better results for your data. When you are satisfied with your settings, click the <strong>submit</strong>
            button at the bottom of the page.
            <br>
            <br>
            <i class="fa fa-info-circle" style="font-size:20px;color:red;"></i> If the <strong>Automatic</strong> algorithm is selected, be sure that the setting for classification/regression is properly configured.
            <br>
            <br>
            <img class="tut-img" src="/static/img/tutorial/train_model_2.png">
            <br>
            <br>
            After the model is trained, you will be able to see it in the <strong>Manage Models</strong> page. Here, you can edit, delete, and see some basic properties
            of the model.
            <br>
            <br>
            <img class="tut-img" src="/static/img/tutorial/manage_models_1.png">
            <br>
            <br>
            In order to use the model that you have generated, navigate to the <strong>Use Model</strong> page.<br>
            <br>
            You will be instructed to select the file that you would like to use to make predictions. In this case, we will select the
            <i>iris_test_unlabeled</i> data.
            <br>
            <br>
            <img class="tut-img" src="/static/img/tutorial/use_model_1.png">
            <br>
            <br>
            After selecting the file you'd like to use for model input, you will be met with a page that looks very similar to the model training screen.<br>
            Simply select the appropriate <strong>target</strong>, <strong>input</strong>, and <strong>ignore</strong> settings for each column, making sure this
            lines up with the options you selected before training the model.
            <br>
            Next, select the model you'd like to use and hit <strong>Submit and Download</strong> in order to download the results. The results will also be stored
            in EasyML and visible from the <strong>Manage Data</strong> page.
            <br>
            <br>
            <img class="tut-img" src="/static/img/tutorial/use_model_2.png">
            <br>
            <br>
            Finally, make sure your results are accurate! Using the <i>iris_test</i> data, our "answer key", you can verify the accuracy of the predictions that
            you just made.<br>
            Select the two files that you'd like to compare, the column to compare, and the comparison method. In this case, we will compare our
            answer key with the results we just generated from the model we trained<br><br>

            <strong>Accuracy</strong> will measure, as a percentage, how many labels were correctly guessed by the model. This is used for classification problems.<br>
            <strong>Correlation</strong> will measure, as an R<sup>2</sup> value, how closely the predictions are correlated with the actual answers. This is used for regression problems.<br>
            <br>
            Hit <strong>submit</strong> and immediately see your results!
